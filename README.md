## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Local Storage

I built this project using vanilla js, local storage for storing the information, html, and css. The css uses variables for color access. The font uses google fonts.

## Optimizations


One thing I would optimize is the layout of the page. I could lay some tailwind.css or even react/angular on top of this.

## Lessons Learned:

While working on this project I learned how to use local storage and what it is. I also learned about cookies and how to add them to projects.
